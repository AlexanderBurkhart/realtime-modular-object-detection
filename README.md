# Real Time Modular Object Detection

This project is aimed to detect any specific type of object in real time by passing a dataset of the object. There are three folders that show the progress of the different algorithms in this project. 

- Has support to use [Zynq UltraScale+](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu104.html) as a processor for optical flow

**Use the _obj-detection-frcnn_ for best results.**

All of the algorithms are tested on the townsend data sets. 
Results for each algorithm are shown below:

#### Using Faster R-CNN:
#### Using U-Net:
#### Using Optical Flow with a Simple Classifier:
